# Intelligent Household Waste Management Assistant

## Project Overview
This project, part of the Week 1 submission, aims to develop an intelligent 'Household Waste Management Assistant' using AI-powered image classification. The system is designed to instantly identify common household waste items from an image and provide users with immediate, actionable guidance on proper disposal. This empowers households to manage waste effectively, maintain a clean environment, and reduce their ecological footprint.

## Problem Statement
In many households, improper waste segregation is a significant challenge due to a lack of awareness or convenience. This project tackles this issue by creating an easy-to-use tool that removes the guesswork from waste disposal, especially when municipal services are irregular.

## Week 1 Milestone: Project Setup and Data Analysis
This repository marks the completion of the first-week milestone. The primary objectives for this week were to establish a structured project foundation, gather and analyze relevant datasets, and outline the data preprocessing strategy.

### 1. Project Structure
- **`/data`**: This directory is reserved for the raw and processed datasets (ignored by Git).
- **`/notebooks`**: Contains the Jupyter Notebooks for the project.
- **`README.md`**: Provides this comprehensive overview of the project.

### 2. Dataset Gathering and Analysis
- **Dataset 1 Source:** [Garbage Classification (12 classes)
Images dataset for classifying household garbage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification)
- **Dataset 2 Source:** *[Recyclable and Household Waste Classification
15,000 Recyclable and Household Waste Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alistairking/recyclable-and-household-waste-classification)*
- **Initial Analysis:** The Jupyter Notebook for the full exploratory data analysis has been created as a placeholder (`/notebooks/1_Data_Exploration_and_Preprocessing.ipynb`). It will be populated with the complete script and its output shortly. The core plan is to analyze class distribution and preprocess the data into four target categories.

### 3. Next Steps (Week 2 Plan)
-   Complete and push the data exploration and preprocessing script.
-   Develop and train a baseline CNN model using transfer learning.

-   Evaluate the baseline model's performance.
